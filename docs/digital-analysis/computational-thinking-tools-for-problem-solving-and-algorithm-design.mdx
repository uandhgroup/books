## Process of computational thinking
`-` Decomposition - breaking down a complex problem or system into manageable components <br />
`-` Pattern recognition - identification of patterns within problems <br />
`-` Abstraction - analyse information, filter and remove unnecessary detail <br />
`-` Action: <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` Sequence - order of processes <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` Selection - execution only when conditions met <br />
`â””â”€â”€` Iteration - repetition until conditions met <br />
