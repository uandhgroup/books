<p className="grey">A process or set of clearly defined rules followed to support calculations or problem solving. </p>

## Characteristics

`Finiteness` - Finite number of steps <br />
`Unambiguous` - Steps must be clear and lead to one meaning <br />
`-` Clearly defined inputs and outputs <br />
`-` Logical sequencing of steps <br />
`-` Iteration - repetition of steps until results achieved <br />
`-` Selection - input leading to choice of step <br />
`-` Structured English <br />

## Application
When can this be used?

`-` Automate calculations to improve efficiency of a process <br />
`-` Design a step by step solution to solve a problem <br />
`-` Supports machine learning for data analysis <br />

## Forms
Algorithms can come in different forms. For example, a flow chart can be one way of displaying an algorithm
