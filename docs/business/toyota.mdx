Toyotal believes that waste is anything that doesn't add to what the end user would pay for. 

The seven wastes are: 
1. Over production
2. Waiting
3. Transporting
4. Innapropriate processing
5. Unnecessary inventory
6. Unnecessary / excess motion
7. Defects

Toyota production system is based on two concepts:

:::tip jidoka
A Japanese term that can be translated as "automation with human touch". It is a method for quickly idenifying and correcting any idues that could lead to faulty production.
:::

:::tip Just in time
Refining and coordinating each production process in a sequence, just when it's needed.
:::


By applying these two concepts, Toyota can produce vehicles quickly and efficiently. Especially, making what is needed when it's needed.
