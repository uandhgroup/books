Lean manufacturing, the manufacturing method that Toyota uses. 

### Lean manufacturing
A production process based on an ideology of maxamising productivity while simultaneously minimising waste within a manufacturing operation.

The LEAN principle sees waste as anything that doesn't add value that the customers are willing to pay for.

### Benefits
- Reduced lead times and operting costs
- Improved product quality

### Ways to do it
- **Eliminate waste:** Waste is a negative factor for cost, deeadliness and resources. It also provides no value or services.
- **Improve quality:** Improved quality allows companies to stay competitive and meet the changing needs and the wants of customers.
- **Reducing costs:** Over production or having more materials than is required creates storage costs, which can be reduced through better processes and materials management.
- **Reducing time:** Wasting time with inefficient practices is a waste of money too, while more efficient practices create shorter lead times and allow for goods and services to be delivered faster.

:::tip example
An example of a business that uses LEAN manufacturing is Toyota

### LEAN at a non manufacturing business
Lean would work just as well at a non manufacturing business, as the waste in most organisations is high, therefore there is more of an oppourtunity for LEAN to take effect.
