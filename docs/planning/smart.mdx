SMART is an acronym for:

`S`pecific <br />
`M`easurable <br />
`A`chievable <br />
`R`elevant <br />
`T`ime Bound <br />

## Creating and using a SMART goal

### Specific

When drafting a goal, try to answer the five "W" questions: <br />

`What` do I want to accomplish? <br />
`Why` is this goal important? <br />
`Who` is involved? <br />
`Where` is it located? <br />
`Which` resources or limits are involved? <br />

### Measurable

Measurable questions are questions such as: <br />
`-` How much? <br />
`-` How many? <br />
`-` How will I know when it is accomplished? <br />

### Achievable

Achievable goals usually answer questions such as: <br />

`-` How can I accomplish this goal? <br />
`-` How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors? <br />

### Relevant

A goal can answer here can be "yes" or "no": <br />

`-` Does this seem worthwhile? <br />
`-` Is this the right time? <br />
`-` Does this match our other efforts/needs? <br />
`-` Am I the right person to reach this goal? <br />
`-` Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment? <br />

### Time-bound

A time-bound goal will usually answer these questions: <br />

`-` When? <br />
`-` What can I do six months from now? <br />
`-` What can I do six weeks from now? <br />
`-` What can I do today? <br />
