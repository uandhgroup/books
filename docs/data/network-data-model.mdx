---

A database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. 

This model tries to overcome the [hierachcical data model](/data/hdm)

A child none can link to many different parents. 

Parent nodes are called owners and child nodes are called members. 

This model does support M:M

### Pros
`-` Capability to handle more relationship types - Can handle the one to many and many to many relationship <br />
`-` Easy of access data - The data access is easier and more flexible the hierarchical data model - Because of the multiple connections, more ways to access data. <br />
`-` Data integrity - The network model does not allow a member to exist without an owner <br />
`-` Conceptually easy to design

### Cons
`-` System complecity - All the records are maintained using pointers and hence the whole database structure becomes very compelx <br />
`-` Structure is not user friendly <br />
