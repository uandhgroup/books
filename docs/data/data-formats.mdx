### Why?

We have different file formats because: <br />

`-` Standards <br />
`-` File size <br />
`-` Compatibility <br />
`-` Quality <br />
`-` Editing <br />

### Compression
`-` Lossy <br />
â €`-` Loose quality, flile size smaller <br />
`-` Lossless <br />
â €`-` Keep quality, file size smaller <br />

## PNG vs JPG

PNG will be the same after compression, it is lossles Compression

JPG quality is lower than PNG, it is lossy compression.

## File structures

### File based structure
Flat files <br />
Data grouped based on a type of file.  <br />
One file that stores data in a logical format.

:::tip example
Spreadsheet
:::

### Directory based structure
Data in files within separate organised folders. Structure tends to be hierarchical.

### Relational database models
Organised data in tables, which are linked together. Data is a particular scenario.

#### Advantages
`-` Flexible in handline data <br />
`-` Organised data in separate tables <br />
`-` Simpler compared to other models <br />
`-` Easy to back up data <br />

### Disadvantages
`-` Initial setup costs are expensive <br />
`-` Can get slow peformance, depending on data stored <br />
`-` Can be complex to store large amounts of data <br />

### Flat files vs Relational based structure

#### Advantages
`-` Flat files are easy to manage, due to one file <br />
`-` Flat files require less hardware/software <br />
`-` Easier to unserstand and setup <br />

#### Disadvantages
`-` Flat files are less secure <br />
`-` Flat files can get data entry errors <br />
`-` Flat files have repeated data, causing confusion and update errors <br />
`-` Difficult to update <br />
