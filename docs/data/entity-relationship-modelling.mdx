---

A type of diagram that lets you see how different entities (e.g. people, customers, or other objects) relate to each other in an application or a database.


It's used to represent data in a given scenario. <br />
Entity relationship models have 3 components: <br />
`-` Entities <br />
`-` Attributes <br />
`-` Relationships <br />


### Explanation

An **entity** is something in the real world that can be represented in the system. These could be: `books`, `people`, `a bag` etc... <br />
Each **entity** is represented by a rectangular box with its name written inside it. <br />
The information held on an entity is a set of characteristics that define the entity. These are known as `attributes` <br />
The `relationship` between the entity, attributes and other entities are the `relationships`.

## Degree of the relationship

### 1:1
One to One
This is when something is directly linking to something else. 

#### Example:
![](/img/1to1.png)

### 1:M
One to Many <br />
When something is linking to multiple other things

#### Example
![](/img/1tom.png)

### M:M
Many to Many <br />
This is where any things link with many things

#### Example
![](/img/mtom.png)
