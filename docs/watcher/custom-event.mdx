# Custom event(s)

Triggers when a smart contract emits one or multiple events you select from your ABI.
To monitor events from a smart contract, the ABI of your contract must include events that are emitted.

:::caution

To use the custom events feature, you need to deploy or import your smart contract with Starton. For more information, see understanding smart contracts.

## Creating a watcher from a custom event type

You can create a watcher to monitor blockchain event.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code" label="From Code">
To create a watcher from the code of you application, use the following snippet.
You can find the full list of networks and event types in our <Link to="/api-reference">API reference</Link>.

```js
const axios = require("axios")
// First, authenticate to the API
const startonApi = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
})
// Use the watcher creation endpoint
startonApi
	.post("/v3/watcher", {
		name: "Name of your watcher", // Enter a name for your watcher
		description: "Describe your watcher", // Enter a description for your watcher
		address: "0x000000000000", // Enter the address to watch (either a wallet or a smart contract)
		network: "polygon-mumbai", // Enter a network, you can find the list of networks available in our API reference.
		type: "EVENT_CUSTOM", // Select the custom event type
		customEventAbi: {}, // Here you will specify the event you want to monitor from the ABI of your contract.
		webhookUrl: "https://xxxxxxx/", // Enter the address of the webhook
		confirmationsBlocks: 50, // Depending on your needs, select the number of confirmed blocks before an event triggers your watcher
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```

To emit events, your smart contract must contain an event and an emit.

For example, in the following contract, the setData event is emitted.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SimpleStorage {
    string data;

   event dataSet(string _data);
   constructor (string memory _data) {
       data = _data;
   }

   function getData() public view returns(string memory) {
       return data;
   }

   function setData(string memory _data) public returns(string memory) {
       data = _data;
       emit dataSet(_data);
       return data;
   }
}
```

Consequently the event in the ABI will include an object with the type "event", which is what you will enter as customEventABI:

```json
[
	{
		"anonymous": false,
		"inputs": [
			{
				"indexed": false,
				"internalType": "string",
				"name": "_data",
				"type": "string"
			}
		],
		"name": "dataSet",
		"type": "event"
	}
]
```
