This library is aimed at bringing the modern back-end development tools to the [Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/uandhgroup/eightshift-boilerplate) or [Eightshift Boilerplate Plugin](https://github.com/uandhgroup/eightshift-boilerplate-plugin), but you can use it on any WordPress project.
