---

<p className="grey">Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users.</p>

Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion.

If more people encounter similar problems, recommendations will be made to overcome these usability issues.

## Advantages
`-` Feedback direct from the target audience to focus the project team. <br />
`-` Internal databases can be resolved by testing the issue to see how users react to the different options being discussed. <br />
`-` Issues and potential problems are highlighted before the product is launched <br />
`-` It increases the likelihood of usage and repeat usage <br />
`-` It minimises the risk of the product failing <br />
`-` Users are better able to reach their goals, which results in the business meeting its targets. <br />

## Disadvantages
`-` Testing is not 100% representative of the real life scenario. For example, a mother will not have her two young children running around like she might have at home. <br />
`-` Usability testing is mainly qualitative so does not provide the large samples of feedback that a questionnaire might, but the feedback can be far more accurate and insightful. <br />
