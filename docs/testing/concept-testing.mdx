<p className="grey">When you have a big idea that you want to get right, it can save you a lot of time and money to concept test it before you bring it to the world.</p>

Concept testing allows you to refine a product concept, advertisement, new logo, website etc by getting feedback directly from your target market.

## Example
A marketing team might hold a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for an advertising campaign for a new product. When the session is over, there are dozens of options on the table, and a few seem like real winners.

Questions may include:

`-` Does this ad stand out against my competitors' ad? <br />
`-` Does this ad capture viewers/listeners attention? <br />
`-` Do you recognise this brand? <br />
`-` Would you trust this brand? <br />
`-` Which button would make you buy? <br />
