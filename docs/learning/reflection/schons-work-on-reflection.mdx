<p className="grey">Donald Sch√ñn (1930 - 1997) was an academic and he is credited as developing the concept of reflective practice.</p>

Sch√ñns work distinguishes between reflection `in` and `on` action.

## Explained
Reflection `in` action is carried out while an experience is actually taking place <br />
Reflection `on` action can take place any time after the experience has ended
