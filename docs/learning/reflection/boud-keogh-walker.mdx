<p className="grey">David Boud, Rosemary Keough and David Walker's reflective model (1985), suggests that emotion is integral to the reflective process.</p>

Reflection requires individuals to think about, reflect on and evaluate their experiences

This model has `three` stages. It focuses on on the user's emotions, rather than taking a purely logical view of the situation or experience.

The reflection can help the user to change behaviour allowing success in a situation where negativity has previously prevented a breakthrough.
