## FAQ

### What Happens After Approval?

Once your source is approved, new posts from your source will be automatically collected, analyzed, and potentially added to the feed going forward. Please note that we do not auto-populate the feed with historical content from newly approved sources. Only content published after the approval date will be considered. Allow a few days for full synchronization.

### Is Approval Permanent?

Continuous monitoring of new sources is part of our commitment to maintain content quality. Misuse of the platform could lead to the disqualification of your approved source.

### Can I Resubmit a Rejected Source?

Yes, but only after making substantial changes. For additional details or support, contact support@daily.dev.
