## Tips
`-` Use mostly **close ended** questions <br />
Open ended questions take more time and effort to answer.  <br />

`-` Keep a balanced set of answer choices, but not too many <br />
Responsents need a way to provide feedback. Having too many (scale of 1-10) would make it hard to determine what the difference beterrn a 7 and an 8 rating is. However a 1-3 or 1-4 rating could make it easier. <br />

`-` Keep questions different <br />
Asking the same question over and over can get annoying and respondents could give a bad rating if they get annoyed. <br />

`-` Optional answers <br />
Keep most answers optional. If respondents don't want to/feel comfortable answering a question, they could put a false answer in. <br />

`-` Keep it short <br />
Too many questions and the respondents can get bored and frustrated. <br />

`-` Terminology <br />
Ensure terminology used links with the respondents' knowledge. <br />
