## CIA
In security terms, `CIA` stands for: **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability** <br />
These three principles form the cornerstone of any organisation's security infrastructure.

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality has been written about here [Confidentiality](/test "pageRef")

## Integrity
Integrity is about ensuring that data has not been tampered with and can be trusted. It is correct, authentic and reliable.

Integrity can be compromised directly by methods including:

### Deliberately
`-` Tampering with intrusion detection systems <br />
`-` Modifying configuration files <br />
`-` Changing system logs to evade detection <br />

### Unintentionally
`-` Through human error <br />
`-` Lack of care <br />
`-` Coding errors <br />
`-` Inadequate policies, procedures, and protection mechanisms <br />

### How can integrity be ensured?
`-` Encryption <br />
`-` Hashing <br />
`-` Digital signatures <br />
`-` Digital certificates <br />
`-` Intrusion detection systems <br />
`-` Auditing <br />
`-` Version control <br />
`-`  Strong authentication mechanisms and access controls <br />

## Availability
Availability means that networks, systems and applications are up and running. It ensures authorused users have timely, reliable access to resources when they're needed <br />
Things can jeopardise availability, including: <br />
`-` Hardware or software failure <br />
`-` Power failure <br />
`-` Natural disasters <br />
`-` Human error <br />

:::tip Example
The most well known attack that threatens availability is the denial of service attack, in which the performance of a systsm, website, web based application/service is degraded and the syste, becomes unreachable.

### How can availibility be ensured?
`-` Redundancy (in servers, networks, applications and services) <br />
`-` Hardware fault tolerance (for servers and storage) <br />
`-` Regular software patching and system upgrades <br />
`-` Backups <br />
`-` Comprehensive disaster recovery plans <br />
`-` Denial-of-service protection solutions <br />

## IAAA
This is **Identification, Authentication, Authorisation and Accountability** <br />
These are key concepts to understanding identity access management.

### Identification
This is **who you are** <br />
Without identifying yourself, you cannot access a system <br />
Normal methods of identification includes: <br />
`-` Your name <br />
`-` Username <br />
`-` ID number <br />

### Authentication
After you've identified yourself, you need to prove you are who you say you are. That is `authentication`. <br />
Authentication methods: <br />
` - ` Something you know, password <br />
` - ` Something you have, token <br />
` - ` Something you are, fingerprint <br />
` - ` Something you are, IP address <br />
` - ` Something you can do, signature <br />


### Authorisation
Once you've identified and proved who you are using authentication, you will be given access to the system once your authorisation has been determined. <br />
**What is authorisation** <br />
` - `  Authorisation determines which part of the system / data you are allowed to access and what actions you are allowed to do with that access. For example, read and write. <br />

### Accountability
Once you've been given access to a system and authorised to perform certain tasks, accountability takes place. <br />
**What is accountability?** <br />
` - ` Being able to trace an action back to an individual <br />
` - ` Prove what someone did, and when they did it: known as `non-repudiation` <br />
` - ` This is also known as auditing (audit logs)


## Maintaining CIA

**Why is it important?**

` - ` Maintains compliance with legislation <br />
` - ` Maintains trust with internal and external stakeholders <br />
` - ` Promotes positive brand image <br />
` - ` Avoids security risks and unauthorised access <br />

## Lack of CIA

**Consequences** <br />

**Financial** <br />
` - ` Regulatory fines <br />
` - ` Refunds/compensation to customers <br />
` - ` Loss of earnings <br />

**Legal** <br />
` - ` Lawsuits <br />
` - ` Termination of contract <br />

**Reputational** <br />
` - ` Loss of customers <br />
` - ` Damage to brand <br />
