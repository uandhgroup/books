<p className="grey">Incident response is what you do when an incident is logged. </p>

`1.` Initial diagnostic – This occurs when the user describes his or her problem and answers troubleshooting questions <br />

`2.` Incident escalation – This happens when an incident requires advanced support, such as sending an on-site technician or assistance from a certified support staff. <br />

`3.` Investigation & diagnostic – Once the incident is diagnosed, staff can apply a solution, such as changing software settings, applying a software patch, or ordering new hardware. <br />

`4.` Resolution & Recovery – This is when the service desk confirms that the users service has been restored to the required SLA level <br />

`5.` Incident Closure – At this point, the incident is considered closed and the incident process ends <br />
