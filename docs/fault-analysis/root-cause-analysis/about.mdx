Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for finding and identifying the root cause of a problem or event. Having a truly effective system means more than just putting out fires all day.

Starts with figuring out how, where and why the issue operated.

Responded to that answer in order to prevent it from happening again.

## Why is root cause analysis necessary?

`-` It is important to focus on cause, not  <br />
`-` Pinpoint the factors that contribute to the problem or event. But its depth also helps you avoid the temptation to single out one issue, over the others  <br />
`-` In order to resolve the problem as fast as possible. It also helps to find the actual cause of the problem as opposed to just fixing the resulting symptoms  <br />
`-` Significantly reduces cost and time spent by catching problems early. Identifying the problems root in the early stages enables developers to maintain and agile environment and drive process improvement  <br />
`-` Even though performing root cause analysis might feel time consuming, the opportunity to eliminate or mitigate risks and root causes is undeniably worthwhile  <br />

## 6 steps

`1.` Define the problem. When a problem or event arises, your first move is to contain or isolate all suspected parts of the problem. This will help contain the problem. <br />
`2.` Gather Data. Once you find the problem, compile all data and evidence related to the specific issue to begin understanding what might be the cause. <br />
`3.` Identify any contributing issues. You might have hands on experiences or stories from others that indicate any additional issues <br />
`4.` Determine root cause. Here's where your root cause analysis really occurs. You can use a variety of RCA techniques. Each technique helps you search for small clues that may reveal the root cause, allowing the person or team to correctly identify what went wrong. <br />
`5.` Implement the solution. Determining the root cause will likely indicate one or several solutions. You might be able to implement the solution right away. Or, the solution may require some additional work. Either way, RCA isn't done until you‚Äôve implemented a solution. <br />
`6.` Document actions taken. After you‚Äôve identified and sloved he root problem, document the problems and the overall resolution so that future engineers can use it as a resource. <br />
