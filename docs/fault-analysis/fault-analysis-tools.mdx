## Fault Identification

`-` System Alerts <br />
`-` Activity / error <br />
`-` Live traces <br />
`-` Dashboards

## System Alerts
This alerts the user to the problem. If a tool creates multiple alerts about the same problem, it automatically correlates them and combines them into one alert before sending it. <br />
When a fault is detected, an administrator is notified using an alarm or alert. <br />
Alerts correspond to notifying the appropriate person to deal with the event.

## Activity/error logs

Event Viewer is a tool in Windows that displays detailed information about significant events on your computer

Examples of these are programs that don't start as expected, or automatically downloaded updates

Event Viewer is especially useful for troubleshooting Windows and application errors

## Event viewer events
**Event Viewer displays these types of events**

`-` Error <br />
`-` Warning <br />
`-` Information <br />
`-` Success Audit <br />
`-` Failure Audit <br />
`-` The event log <br />

### Error
A significant problem, such as loss of data or loss of functionality. For example, if a service fails to load during start-up, an error will be logged.

### Warning
An event that is not necessarily significant, but may indicate a possible future problem. For example, when disk space is low, a warning will be logged.

### Information
An event that describes the successful operation of an application, driver, or service. For example, when a network driver loads successfully, an Information event will be logged.

### Success Audit
An audited security access attempt that succeeds. For example, a user's successful attempt to log on to the system will be logged as a Success Audit event.

### Failure Audit
An audited security access attempt that fails. For example, if a user tries to access a network drive and fails, the attempt will be logged as a Failure Audit event.

### The event log
Starts automatically when you start Windows. Application and System logs can be viewed by all users, but Security logs are accessible only to administrators.

## Live traces
Live traces trace the network, such as applications like `angryIP scanner`

## Dashboards
A consolidated visual representation of system condition & performance
