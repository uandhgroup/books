# ERC721 limited supply NFT deployment (with royalties)

The capped meta-transaction smart contract template for single-copy Non Fungible Tokens (NFT). In a video game, you can sell an NFT and pay for gas in place of the NFT receiver. Within this standard, the token is linked to its owner's address and to the URI (Unique Resource Identifier) which references the NFT content.

This version enables you to send transactions on behalf of your users so they can use their NFT without having to pay for gas fees. In contrast to the standard version of meta-transaction where you can mint infinite amount of NFTS, here you can set a maximum limit to the supply of NFTs.

It also includes another feature which is called blacklist. It allows the owner to blacklist one or more addresses to transfer tokens on behalf of your users for example if you want to block sales happening in a marketplace.

Notice that we do not store any content in the smart contract. Smart contract store only references. It is up to smart contract readers to find the content using references.

Starton provides an <Link to="https://app.starton.com/ipfs">IPFS integration</Link> in case you need to host your NFT content.

## Parameters

-   **definitiveName:** The name of your smart contract which will be reflected on-chain.
-   **definitiveSymbol:** The symbol associated with the NFT or its collection.
-   **definitiveMaxSupply:** The maximum number of NFT that can be minted.
-   **initialBaseTokenUri:** Will be used to concatenate NFT URIs :
    -   Using IPFS: `ipfs://ipfs/`
    -   Using a centralised server: `https://yourapi.com/endpoint/`
-   **initialContractUri:** The URI of the metadata that will be used to give more details about the description.
-   **initialOwnerOrMultisigContract:** The address that will own the NFT Collection.
-   **definitiveRoyaltyFee:** The fraction of sale price representing the royalty fees
-   **definitiveFeeReceiver:** The address that will receive the royalty fees
