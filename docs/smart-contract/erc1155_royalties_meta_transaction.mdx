# ERC1155 Deployment of a Collection of NFTs (with royalties)

This meta-transaction version enables you to send transactions on behalf of your users so they can use their NFT without having to pay for gas fees.
It also includes the blacklist feature. It allows the owner to block one or more addresses from transferring tokens on behalf of your users for example if you want to block the sales happening in a marketplace.
Notice that we do not store any content in the smart contract. Smart contract store only references. It is up to smart contract readers to find the content using references.
Starton provides an <Link to="https://app.starton.com/ipfs">IPFS integration</Link> in case you need to host your NFT content.

:::caution

To use this contract, you will need to import the etherjs library, create and sign a typeTransaction before you can use the function executeMetadata().

:::

## Parameters

-   **definitiveName:** The name of your smart contract which will be reflected on-chain.
-   **initialTokenUri:** The token URI of the collection
    -   Using IPFS: `ipfs://ipfs/QmW77ZQQ7Jm9q8WuLbH8YZg2K7T9Qnjbzm7jYVQQrJY5Y/{id}/`
    -   Using a centralised server: `https://yourapi.com/endpoint/{id}`
-   **initialContractUri:** The URI of the metadata that will be used to give more details about the description.
-   **initialOwnerOrMultisigContract:** The address that will own the NFT Collection
-   **definitiveRoyaltyFee:** The fraction of sale price representing the royalty fees
-   **definitiveFeeReceiver:** The address that will receive the royalty fees
