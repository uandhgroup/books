# ERC20 Fungible Token with mintable supply

The mintable version enables the creator to mint new tokens at any time.
The smart contract template for fungible tokens. New tokens can be minted after the initial emission. In a video game, mintable fungible tokens can represent the currency gamers can spend in-game.
This meta-transaction enables you to send transactions on behalf of your users so they can use their tokens without having to pay for gas fees.

:::caution

To use this contract, you will need to import the etherjs library, create and sign a typeTransaction before you can use the function executeMetadata().
