<p className="grey"> Ports are logical channels that the TCP/IP suite uses for communication purposes </p>

Specific processes/applications have dedicated ports from numbers 0-65535, however, the common ones are:

| Port                            | Tags     | Protocol | Description                            |
|---------------------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| 21 - Control <br /> 20 - Data Transfer | `FTP`    | `TCP`    | File downloads                         |
| 22                              | `SSH`    | `TCP`    | Encrypted data exchange                |
| 23                              | `Telnet` | `TCP`    | Remote logging in for terminal servers |
| 25                              | `SMTP`   | `TCP`    | Sending emails                         |
| 53                              | `DNS`    | `UDP`    | Resolves host names to IP addresses    |
| 67                              | `DHCP`   | `UDP`    | Automatic IP addresses assignment      |
| 80                              | `HTTP`   | `TCP`    | Web traffic                            |
| 110                             | `POP3`   | `TCP`    | Receiving emails                       |
| 443                             | `HTTPS`  | `TCP`    | Insecure internet traffic              |
| 3389                            | `RDP`    | `TCP`    | Remote access of clients               |

When an [IP Address](/digital-environments/ip-addresses/about "pageRef") is combined with a network port it is called a socket.
eg. `192.168.100.1:3389`

Ports can be blocked by firewalls which will ultimately prevent devices using the ports designated process.
