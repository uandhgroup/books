<p className="grey">Virtualisation creates a stimulated, or virtual, computing environment, instead of the ordinary physical environment. </p>

One physical device can act as many virtual machines/devices. Known as VMs

## What hardware can be virtualised?

`-` Sound Cards <br />
`-` Video Cards <br />
`-` CPU <br />
`-` Storage <br />
`-` Network <br />
`-` CD/Floppy <br />
`-` Servers <br />
`-` Clients <br />
`-` Switches <br />
`-` Routers <br />

## What do you need to be able to use virtualisation?

`-` Hypervisor <br />
`â””â”€â”€` Enabled in BIOS/UEFI <br />
`-` CPU <br />
`â””â”€â”€` Multicore 64bit processor that supports Intel virtualisation technology or AMD-V <br />
`-` Network <br />
`-` Disk <br />

### Hypervisor
Also known as Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)

## Types
There are two types:

`Type 1`: Server - Runs on the hardware of the device <br />
`Type 2`: Client side - Runs on the top of an existing operating system.

Type 1 doesn't have to load an underlying OS. 

## What are the benefits of virtualisation?


`-` Increased productivity <br />
`-` Faster provisioning of resources <br />
`-` Reduce downtime <br />
`-` Environmentally friendly <br />
`-` Low cost <br />
`-` Quick deployment <br />
`-` Faster backups <br />
`-` Easier testing <br />
