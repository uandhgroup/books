<p className="grey">Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources when needed over the internet. Example: Google Cloud</p>

Cloud computing is a method by which remote servers are used to store files and run applications, rather than storing them locally.

Cloud computing uses `virtualisation` which one physical server hosts virtually many cloud servers.

This is handled behind the scenes and the end user never realises this.

### Advantages and disadvantages

`-` Advantages <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` Easy implementation â€“ Allows businesses to retain the same applications and processes without having to deal with any back end settings. <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` Accessibility - You can access the data anywhere, anytime. <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` No hardware required - Everything is hosted online, so no physical hardware is needed <br />
`â””â”€â”€` Flexibility for growth - The cloud is easily scalable so companies can add or subtract resources based on their needs <br />

`-` Disadvantages <br />
`â”œâ”€â”€` Security <br />

Acts as an operating system for the physical machine and is used for server side virtualisation and has low hardware requirements. Doesn't have to load an underlying OS.


#### Type 2
Installed on top of an existing OS <br />
It relies on the host machines preexisting OS to manage calls to CPU, memory, storage and network resources.

## Benefits
`-` Cloud Portability <br />
`â””â”€â”€` The ability to move applications and data from one cloud computing environment to anther with minimal disruption. <br />
`-` Elastic Cloud <br />
`â””â”€â”€` A cloud computing offering that provides variable service levels based on changing needs. <br />
