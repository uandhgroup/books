<p className="grey">The process of security by reducing its surface of vulnerability.</p>

`-` Eliminating as many security risks/flaws as  <br />
`-` Achieved by removing all non-essential software programs and utilities <br />
`-` Removing default settings <br />
`-` Applying advanced configurations to restrict access <br />

Here are some ways to harden a system: <br />

`1.` [BIOS/UEFI](/digital-environments/BIOS-UEFI "pageRef") <br />
`2.` Built into Windows 10 <br />
`3.` Group policy <br />
`4.` Registry <br />

These are explained below. <br />

### BIOS/UEFI
`-` Password protected <br />
`-` Enable secure boot-UEFI only <br />
`-` Disable ports such as front USB <br />
`-` Enable chassis intrusion detection <br />
`-` Install BIOS and UEFI firmware updates <br />

### Built into Windows 10

`-` Enable passwords for all accounts <br />
`-` Set a password with your screensaver <br />
`-` Enforce password policies <br />
`-` Turn on Windows Firewall <br />
`-` Disable remote access <br />
`-` Enable or install antivirus protection tools <br />
`-` Enable windows updates <br />
`-` Encrypt storage media <br />
`-` Switch off unused services and ports <br />
`-` Remove old device drivers/unused hardware <br />
`-` Apply principle of least priveledge <br />
`-` Lock down features and tools such as gpedit.mdc <br />

### Group Policy
This is controlled by `gpedit.msc`

`-` Restrict access to control <br />
`-` Block Command Prompt <br />
`-` Prevent software installations <br />
`-` Disable forced restarts <br />
`-` Disable automatic driver updates <br /> 
`-` Disable removable media drives <br />
`-` Hide balloon and toast notifications <br />
`-` Remove onedrive <br />

### Registry
`-` This is a set of database settings and opeions installed on all versions of windows  <br /> 
`-` Hives, leys, strings structire  <br />
`-` The regedit allows values to be changed <br />
`-` Windows features can be enabled and disabled <br />

### SOP

It can also help to have a Standard Operating Procedure
