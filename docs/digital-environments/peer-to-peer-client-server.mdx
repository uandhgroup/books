<p className="grey">In a Peer to Peer network, no single provider is responsible for being the server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has equal responsibility for providing data.</p>

Security is an issue in a P2P network.

In a client server, the client is dependent on the server to provide and manage the information.

|   **Security**  | The server controls the security of the network.                                       | No central control over security.                                       |
|  **Management** | The server manages the network. Needs a dedicated team of people to manage the server. | No central control over the network. Anyone can set up.                 |
|  **Dependency** | Clients are dependent on the server.                                                   | Clients are not dependent on a client server.                           |
| **Performance** | The server can be upgraded to be made more powerful to cope with high demand.          | If machines on the network are slow, they will slow down other machines |
|   **Backups**   | Data is all backed up on the main server.                                              | Each computer has to be backed up. Data can easily be deleted by users. |
