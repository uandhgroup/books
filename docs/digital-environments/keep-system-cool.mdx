<p className="grey">How does a system keep cool and what components are crucial?</p>

A system keeps cool with airflow, fans and other types of cooling. 

For example, in a water cooling kit, the device will pump the cold water around, cooling the components down.

### To keep a system cool...

`-` Run PC with case closed <br />
`-` Clean dust off <br />
`-` Move computer away from sunlight <br />
`-` Donâ€™t overclock <br />
`-` Upgrade/replace power supply <br />

### Why is it important?
Keeping computer components cool is essential to preserve the life of components and maximise efficiency. To achieve this, a number of fans, heat sinks and thermal compounds are used.

### How do cooling systems work?
`-` Front intake fans draw fresh cool air into the case <br />
`-` Rear exhaust fans expel warn air from the case <br />
`-` Power supplies have their own fan which draws in external air plus air from the case <br />
`-` The CPU has its own dedicated fan and heat skink which is essential as a CPU can run at 90 degrees <br />
`-` Heatsinks sit on top of chips and processors and use thermal compound to maximise heat transfer efficiency. <br />
