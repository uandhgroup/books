<p className="grey">The fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP)</p>

IP v4 addresses use the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` <br />


Four sets of three digits ranging between 0-255 separated by a full stop. The number 0 and 255 are not usually used for IP addresses. Each set of digits is called an `octet` <br />

Typically, addresses appear as: <br />
`192.168.1.1` - IP Address <br />
`255.255.255.0` - Subnet Mask <br />

Part of the IP address relates to a network address and part to a node address. (Submet mask)

## IP Address Classes
<p className="grey">The first octet of an IP address specifies which class an address belongs to </p>

For each class of addresses a default subnet mask exists.


| IP Address (first octet) | Class | Default subnet mask |
|--------------------------|-------|---------------------|
| 1-126                    | `A`   | 225.0.0.0           |
| 128-191                  | <code className="greennumbercode">B</code>   | 225.225.0.0         |
| 192-223                  | <code className="pinknumbercode">C</code>    | 225.225.225.0       |
