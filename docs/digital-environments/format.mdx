## High and Low level Formatting
### High level
Does not erase all data on the disk, instead, it prepares a disk for reasing and writing by "bookkeeping" information on the disk. It also does some simple testing to make sure all sectors are reliable and then creates internal addresses tables that it later uses to locate information.

### Low level
It is used to initiate a Hard Drive and prepare it for data by creating the acctual sectors and tracks on the drive, as well as the control structures needed to read and write data on the drive.
