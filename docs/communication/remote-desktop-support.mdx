`-` End-users receiving support enjoy faster service which leads to increased satisfaction. <br />


## Two catrgories
<p className="grey">Remote support can be sorted into two categories </p>

`Unattended` and `Attended`. The difference is if the end user is present. <br />

In some circumstances, the end user must be present to ensure the technician isn't accessing any sensitive files.  <br />

### Unattended remote support
`-` Unattended access means the technician can remotely connect to the endpoint device even without an end-user present. <br />
`-` Remote support platforms make this possible by having the IT team deploy an agent app on all the computers they manage. <br />
`-` Once the agent is installed, a member of the IT team can to connect to the remote computer they want to access. <br />
`-` By having the agent installed on the remote computer, IT technicians are able to remotely access the computers at any time, with or without someone actively using the computer. <br />
`-` This makes it possible to support computers outside of regular office hours or when the endpoint is not in use. <br />

### Attended remote support

`-` Also known as on-demand support, or ad-hoc support, attended support allows technicians to access a device the moment the end-user requests assistance. Once connected, the technician can provide support to resolve the issue. <br />
`-` Unlike with unattended access, there is not prior setup necessary for attended access. Because an end-user is present, they are able to help the technician establish a remote connection to their device. <br />
`-` This can be done a variety of ways, but a common method is to have the end-user run the remote support tool‚Äôs app to generate a unique session code, which the user gives to the technician so they can connect to the device and take control. <br />
`-` Attended access enables help desk professionals to provide support to any device as long as the end-user is present. This means they can remotely support managed devices as well as personal devices. <br />
