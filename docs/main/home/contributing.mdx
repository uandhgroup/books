How to contribute

You can contribute by either [opening an issue](https://github.com/PatelN123/Digital-Support-Notes/issues/new) or by creating the fix yourself and submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/PatelN123/Digital-Support-Notes/compare)


This project is how it is today thanks to our contributors. <a href="https://github.com/PatelN123/Digital-Support-Notes/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://opencollective.com/digital-support-notes/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false" /></a>

You'll find the course specification [here](https://www.qualhub.co.uk/media/23823/603-6901-2-qualification-specification.pdf "pageRef"), so if you're going to contribute it's best if you can follow that. We also have a [Computer Science](https://notes.nayanpatel.net/docs/cs) that you can contribute to!
